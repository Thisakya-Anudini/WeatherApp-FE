# Weather App - Frontend

## Overview

The **Frontend** of the **Weather App** provides the user interface (UI) for interacting with the weather data. Built using **React.js** and **Vite**, this frontend communicates with the backend to fetch weather data and displays it in a user-friendly format. The app shows live weather updates, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions like clear sky, rain, etc. Additionally, the app integrates **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** for added security.

This project uses **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and bundling.
